# Biodiversity Summit 2020 POSTPONED

The 2020 annual conference for Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) has been postponed until 2021. The coronavirus pandemic has caused governments around the world to issue directives that require conferences to be cancelled. 

The conference was being organized in collaboration with iDigBio, GBIF, and the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian.  We hope that the crisis will have passed in 18 months, and that we will be able to go forward with the same plans -- to convene in Alexandria, Virginia, USA (just outside of Washington, DC) -- approximately one year later. 

In the meantime, TDWG is evaluating whether a virtual conference this fall would be feasible.  In partcular, we will be seeking input about your experiences with virtual meetings and what features would support the best communication among a world-wide community of participants. Watch for announcements here and subscribe to the [TDWG Announcements mailing list](http://eepurl.com/8VIvn).
