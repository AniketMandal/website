**Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG)**, also known as the Taxonomic Databases Working Group, is a not for profit scientific and educational association that is affiliated with the International Union of Biological Sciences. 

TDWG was formed to establish international collaboration among biological
database projects. TDWG promoted the wider and more effective dissemination of
information about the World's heritage of biological organisms for the benefit
of the world at large. Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) now focuses
on the development of standards for the **exchange** of
biological/biodiversity data.

## Our mission

* Develop, adopt and promote standards and guidelines for the recording and exchange of data about organisms
* Promote the use of standards through the most appropriate and effective means and
* Act as a forum for discussion through holding meetings and through publications
