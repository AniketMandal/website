## What is the TDWG Community Support Fund?

TDWG Interest (IG) and Task (TG) Groups are the organizaitonal entities that undertake standards development and maintenance. Every year, if the budget permits, TDWG supports the work of I/TGs by contributing to the costs of convening ore or two working meetings.

1. Travel and subsistence support for participation in IG/TG working meetings.
1. Costs directly related to the organization of IG/TG working meetings, including venue hire.
1. Costs related to the dissemination of the workshop/meeting results and engagement of stakeholders.

## Who can apply?

TDWG IG/TG conveners may apply for funds to (co-)organize IG/TG working meetings.

Please be aware that proposals from Groups that have a current annual report will be given preference. A [guide to reporting](../management/guide-to-reporting) and a template for IG/TG annual reports (as [GoogleDoc](http://drive.google.com/open?id=1VYHouWmgh94zUibFgDlTW_6cwCTsYbl6Kq9vsczFPjA) or in [Markdown](../management/annual-report-template/).
