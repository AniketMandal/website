TDWG interest (IG) and task (TG) groups undertake the core business of developing and maintaining standards that support integration and interoperability across biodiversity science. The [TDWG Process](../about/process) describes the steps for establishing and maintaining interest and task groups. Additional information can be found in the [community management guidelines]({filename}/pages/community/management/index.md).  Information about active interest and task groups can be found through the links below.

## Community support fund

TDWG is committed to supporting the work of I/TGs by contributing to the costs of conducting working meetings. Support is provided through a fund dedicated to this purpose, the TDWG Community Support Fund (CSF). The size of the Fund is adjusted yearly by decision of the TDWG Executive Committee.  Additional information about the CSF, including how to apply, can be found [here](./support).
