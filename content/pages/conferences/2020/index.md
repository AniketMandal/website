# TDWG 2020 annual conference

Standards that describe and support the exchange of biodiversity information are a critical scientific infrastructure. They enable data to be integrated  in support of research, as well as decision-making and planning for conservation. Ultimately, standards extend the usability of data across taxa, scientific disciplines, and administrative boundaries. Our annual Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) conferences serve two purposes:

to provide a forum for developing, refining, and extending standards in response to new challenges and opportunities; and

to provide a showcase for biodiversity informatics – much of which relies on the standards created by TDWG and other organizations.

In 2020, we cannot meet in person, so [TDWG 2020](/conferences/2020) will be virtual -- a collection of online working sessions, webinar-style symposia, presentations, panel discussions, and recorded presentations. This year we are separating working sessions from dissemination sessions (composed of presentations). Working sessions will be scheduled during the week of September 21-25, and dissemination sessions will be scheduled the week of October 19-23.  This separation will help us minimize parallel sessions, optimize the technologies, and avoid scheduling conflicts with other organizations. It will also give participants in our working sessions time to synthesize their results into presentations.


## Call for Contributions


### Working Sessions for Interest/Task Groups, Workshops, and Hackathons

Working sessions will be structured as meetings in which all
participants can be enabled to speak. Requests to convene working
sessions (including interest and task groups) during the week of
September 21-25 should be submitted through a [*short
survey*](https://tdwg.us9.list-manage.com/track/click?u=50f3cc44307841383062ca0d6&id=664a3297e6&e=70d0b88832).
All I/T-G proposals should be endorsed, if not submitted, by the I/T-G
convener. The survey will close August 1, and a draft schedule of
working sessions will be posted on August 17.\
 

### Symposia, Panel Discussions, Lightning Talks, etc.

Proposals to organize one or more sessions during the week of October
19-23 are being collected via a [*second short
survey*](https://tdwg.us9.list-manage.com/track/click?u=50f3cc44307841383062ca0d6&id=8416bbf4f6&e=70d0b88832). 
This survey will remain open until June 19. Organizers should note the
locations and time zones of all known significant contributors.  They
should also indicate whether the session already has a full complement
of contributors, or whether other relevant talks may be considered for
inclusion.\
 
### Individual Contributions (Presentations, E-Posters)

Abstracts are required for all presentations and e-posters, including
those that are part of a symposium, and should be submitted through the
Pensoft ARPHA system
for [*BISS*](https://biss.pensoft.net).
The call for individual contributions will be posted June 22nd and will
close August 1.  Detailed instructions for making submissions through
ARPHA will be distributed and posted online before the call opens.\
 

## Free Registration

Registration will be required to participate in the online events, but
registration will be free. The services required to run an online
conference, however, are not free. So we encourage all participants to
become TDWG members, either by affiliation with an
existing [*institutional
member*](/about/membership/#institutional%20members%202020_1) or
by paying individual membership dues for the 2020 calendar year
(\$75).  [*Request an invoice*](mailto:secretariat@tdwg.org) to pay
membership online, and help TDWG defray the cost of running the
conference.\
 

## Abstract Publishing Fees

Abstracts will be required for all contributions (i.e., all
presentations and e-posters), and will comprise the Proceedings of TDWG
2020, a collection in [*Biodiversity Information Science and
Standards*](https://biss.pensoft.net).
Normally, we build publishing costs into the registration fees for the
conference. But without a registration fee this year, we are going to
follow the usual model for open-access publishing: authors pay to
publish, and the paper is then free to read forever. The fee for each
abstract will be 40€. The publishing fee may be waived, however, in
cases of financial hardship. Authors please note that abstracts in TDWG
Proceedings can be as large as a small paper (up to 6,000 characters,
including references, authors and affiliations), and may include figures
and links to related media. You can publish something significant for a
nominal fee; less than 1/10th of the cost to publish a full article.\
