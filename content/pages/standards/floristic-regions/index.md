Floristic Regions of the World by A. Takhtajan presents a widely accepted schema of biogeographical areas defined by environmental factors and floristic composition. It is a hierarchical schema that recognizes six floristic kingdoms, 35 floristic regions and 152 floristic provinces.

This schema was endorsed as TDWG standard around 1990
