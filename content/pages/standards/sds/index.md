summary: The TDWG Standards Documentation Standard (SDS) consists of a single document: the [Standards Documentation Specification](https://github.com/tdwg/vocab/blob/master/sds/documentation-specification.md). That document defines how TDWG standards are to be presented. It provides details about the hierarchical structure of standards and versioning of standards components. It specifies how the properties of standards and their components are to be described in human-readable and machine-readable terms.
