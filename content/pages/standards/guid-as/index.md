title: GUID applicability statements
summary: The Global Unique Identifiers (GUID) applicability statements consist of an applicability statement on the use of GUIDs for the biodiversity information community in general ([Richards 2010]({static}tdwg_guid_applicability_statement.pdf)) and the use of Life Science Identifiers (LSID) in specific ([Pereira et al. 2009]({static}tdwg_lsid_applicability_statement.pdf)).
