Abstract
: The Audubon Core (AC) is a set of vocabularies designed to represent metadata for biodiversity multimedia resources and collections. These vocabularies aim to represent information that will help to determine whether a particular resource or collection will be fit for some particular biodiversity science application before acquiring the media. Among others, the vocabularies address such concerns as the management of the media and collections, descriptions of their content, their taxonomic, geographic, and temporal coverage, and the appropriate ways to retrieve, attribute and reproduce them.

## Parts of the standard

The Audubon Core standard is comprised of one vocabulary, the Audubon Core basic vocabulary (http://rs.tdwg.org/ac/), and four documents:

- [Audubon Core Introduction](https://tdwg.github.io/ac/introduction) (http://rs.tdwg.org/ac/doc/introduction/) - a brief introduction to the standard
- [Audubon Core Structure](https://tdwg.github.io/ac/structure) (http://rs.tdwg.org/ac/doc/structure/) - the normative description of the structure of Audubon Core
- [Audubon Core Term List](https://tdwg.github.io/ac/termlist) (http://rs.tdwg.org/ac/doc/termlist/) - a complete list of terms included in Audubon Core, with their normative definitions
- [Audubon Core Guide](https://tdwg.github.io/ac/guide) (http://rs.tdwg.org/ac/doc/guide/) - a more detailed guide to the aims and uses of the vocabulary

## Maintenance Group

Audubon Core is maintained by a specialized Interest Group whose [charter](https://github.com/tdwg/ac/blob/master/audubon-core_maintenance-group_charter.md) was approved in January 2018. The functions of the Audubon Core Maintenance Group are described in detail in [Section 2 of the TDWG Vocabulary Maintenance Specification](https://github.com/tdwg/vocab/blob/master/vms/maintenance-specification.md#2-administration). In brief, the Maintenance Group manages vocabulary term additions and changes, and maintains the documentation that helps users to understand and apply the standard. As an Interest Group, it may establish Task Groups to accomplish broader changes to the standard.

The activities of the AC Maintenance Group are documented at the group's Github repository, https://github.com/tdwg/ac, where a current list of core members and their contact information can be found.  Community participation is welcome.  If you would like to participate in this group, contact the convener or one of the core members.  

To participate in the communications of the group, "watch" the group's [Issues tracker](https://github.com/tdwg/ac/issues).  This issues tracker is the mechanism for suggesting specific changes to the standard as well as to raise issues for discussion by the group.
