summary: Darwin Core is a standard maintained by the [Darwin Core maintenance group](../../community/dwc). It includes a glossary of terms intended to **facilitate the sharing of information about biological diversity** by providing identifiers, labels, and definitions. Darwin Core is primarily based on taxa, their occurrence in nature as documented by observations, specimens, samples, and related information.

Abstract
: Darwin Core is a standard maintained by the Darwin Core maintenance group. It includes a glossary of terms (in other contexts these might be called properties, elements, fields, columns, attributes, or concepts) intended to **facilitate the sharing of information about biological diversity** by providing identifiers, labels, and definitions. Darwin Core is primarily based on taxa, their occurrence in nature as documented by observations, specimens, samples, and related information.

## Parts of the standard

The Darwin Core standard is comprised of one vocabulary, the Darwin Core vocabulary (<http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/>), and five documents:

- [Simple Darwin Core Guide](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/simple/) - a guide for sharing information using the simplest methods
- [Darwin Core Text Guide](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/guides/text/) - a guide for sharing information using text files
- [Darwin Core XML Guide](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/guides/xml/) - a guide for constructing application schemas using XML
- [Darwin Core RDF Guide](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/guides/rdf/) - a guide for encoding biodiversity data using the Resource Description Framework (RDF)
- [Darwin Core Namespace Policy](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/namespace/) - an explanation of how URIs for Darwin Core terms should be constructed

## Maintenance group

Modifications and enhancements to Darwin Core are managed by the [Darwin Core Maintenance Group](../../community/dwc).

The best way to be involved is to create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com), and "watch" the [Darwin Core GitHub repository](https://github.com/tdwg/dwc), as well as the [Darwin Core Questions & Answers repository](https://github.com/tdwg/dwc-qa), and respond to requests for comments or "issues" ([Darwin Core issues](https://github.com/tdwg/dwc/issues) and [Darwin Core QA issues](https://github.com/tdwg/dwc-qa/issues/)). Information about how to suggest changes to the standard can be found at the [Guidelines for Contributing](https://github.com/tdwg/dwc/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) page.

## Scope of Darwin Core

What is in scope?

What is not in scope?

- Data interchange protocols.
- Non-biodiversity-related data.
- Purely taxonomic data.
