TDWG is a bottom up organization; it depends on the expertise and efforts of people who create, manage, integrate, and analyze biodiversity information. Most are professional biologists or information scientists, but all have a passion for living things. If your works involves large quantities of biodiversity information, then information management is one of your challenges. TDWG is good place to learn, share, and collaborate in biodiversity informatics.

## Resources

The following resources will help you learn about TDWG, stay aware of developments, and participate in the advancement of biodiversity information science.

TDWG's mission, structure, membership, and governance are established in its **[Constitution](./constitution/).**  Anyone can be a member.  Members elect an **[Executive Committee](executive)** to set direction, coordinate and manage standards development, and oversee day-to-day operations.  Additional on-going support is provided by **[functional subcommittees](committees/)** (i.e., standing committees), whose leaders are also elected by members and serve _ex-officio_ on the Executive Committee.  

TDWG **[standards](/standards/)** are developed by **[interest groups](/community/).** The process for establishing interest groups and ratifying standards is described in the **[TDWG Process]().**  

[Incorporation and Status]()


### Website

This website should be the most concise introduction to TDWG, as well as a comprehensive directory to activities and resources. Please give feedback and help us maintain the content here (see Website FAQ).

### Announcements

Subscribe to **[TDWG announcements](http://eepurl.com/8VIvn)** to receive our most significant news. This mailing list is for announcements only, not discussion, so the volume is low. (_ca_. 1,000 subscribers.)

### GitHub

TDWG is now using GitHub as its primary [collaboration platform](https://github.com/tdwg). The content for all [interest groups](../../community/) and [standards](../../standards/) is publicly available, but to participate effectively you should create a user account on GitHub (free). With a user account you can monitor the repositories relevant to your interests and ultimately participate in the development of biodiversity information standards.  Note that _"watching"_ a repository is effectively subscribing to the online discussion of issues (problems and solutions) in that subject area.

### Conferences

For many people, their first experience of TDWG comes through participating in the annual conference. These are usually in the Fall and occupy the full five days of a work week (Mon-Fri).  Conferences rotate among the continents on pattern something like "Europe, North America, other", where "other" can be Australia/Oceania, Latin America, Asia, and Africa. Since 2006 the annual conference has drawn betwen 150 and 225 participants.

Conference Proceedings (abstracts of presentations) are available online since 2006. Powerpoint or PDF files are available for many presentations since 2008, and recordings are available for most presentations since 2015.
