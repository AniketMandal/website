TDWG is an open, bottom-up organization. Anyone can become a member. Institutions (including government agencies, non-governmental organizations, programs, and projects) can also become members. Everything TDWG produces comes from the expertise, collaboration, and support of its members -- people and organizations who create, manage, integrate, and analyze biodiversity information. Individual members are professional biologists or information scientists, but all have a passion for living things. If _your_ work involves large quantities of biodiversity information, then you might recoognize that information management is one of your challenges. TDWG is good place to learn about the synthetic discipline of biodiversity informatics.  Get involved, share your experiences, and collaborate with your peers to build future solutions.

TDWG's mission, structure, membership, and governance are established in its **[Constitution](./constitution/).**  Members elect officers to an **[Executive Committee](executive)**, which then sets direction, coordinates standards development, and oversees day-to-day operations.  Additional on-going support is provided by **[functional subcommittees](committees/)** (i.e., standing committees), whose leaders are also elected by members and serve _ex-officio_ on the Executive Committee.  

TDWG **[standards](/standards/)** are developed by **[interest groups](/community/).** The process for establishing interest groups and ratifying standards is described in the **[TDWG Process]().**  More recently, TDWG has adopted another specification to guide the incremental [maintenance of vocabulary standards](https://dev.tdwg.org/standards/vms/).

TDWG is incorporated in California and has formal 501(c)(3) non-profit status in the United States. TDWG is also registered as a "stichting" (foundation) in the Netherlands, giving it non-profit status in the European Union.  See formal registration documents and filings [here](./incorporation/).

The following resources will help you learn about TDWG, stay aware of developments, and participate in the advancement of biodiversity information science.

## Resources

#### Website

This website should be the most concise introduction to TDWG, as well as a comprehensive directory to activities and resources. Please give feedback and help us maintain the content here (see [Website FAQ](./website_faq/)).

#### [Announcements](http://eepurl.com/8VIvn)

Subscribe to [TDWG announcements](http://eepurl.com/8VIvn) to receive our most significant news. This mailing list is for announcements only, not discussion, so the volume is low. (_ca_. 1,000 subscribers.)

#### [GitHub](https://github.com/tdwg)

TDWG is now using GitHub as its primary collaboration platform. It combines the functions of online discussion, collaborative document writing, and code repository. The content for all [interest groups](../../community/) and [standards](../../standards/) is publicly available (no account needed to view), but to participate effectively you should create a user account on GitHub. With a user account you can watch relevant repositories and ultimately participate in developing guidelines or standards in that area. _"Watching"_ a repository is effectively subscribing to the online discussion of issues (problems and solutions) in that subject area. Peter Desmet gave us a nice [tutorial on GitHub using TDWG examples](https://vimeo.com/album/4308386/video/195812163) in 2016. 

#### [Biodiversity Information Science and Standards (BISS)](/journal/)

TDWG has engaged Pensoft, an academic publishing company specializing in open-access semantic publishing, to publish our annual Proceedings (abstracts of contributions to the annual conference), as well as descriptions of new TDWG standards and independently contributed full-length papers.  (See [Journal](/journal/).)

## Participate and contribute

Participation is the key driver of progress. You do not have to be a member to participate. Begin by reading and getting oriented, then participate in our community of interest groups by sharing your opinions and ideas. Ultimately, become a leader in TDWG by standing for election to the Executive Committee or volunteering to lead an interest group or contribute to the work of a [subcommittee](./committees/).

#### Conferences

TDWG's annual conferences are usually held in the fall and occupy a full work week (Mon-Fri).  Conference locations rotate among the continents something like "Europe, North America, and other", where "other" can be Africa, Asia, Australia/Oceania, or Latin America. Conferences typically draw between 150 and 225 participants.

Conference Proceedings (abstracts of presentations) are available online since 2006. Presentations (PPT or PDF) files are available for many presentations since 2008, and recordings are available for most presentations since 2015.  From 2017 going forward, our conference proceedings (abstracts of contributions) will be published in our journal, [Biodiversity Information Science and Standards (BISS)](/journal/).
