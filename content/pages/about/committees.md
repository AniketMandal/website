title: Executive committee

_Copied from <http://www.tdwg.org/about-tdwg/executive/exec-comm-2017/>_

The TDWG Executive is elected in the 3rd or 4th Quarter of the year. Nominations are opened before the annual meeting and voting by email is conducted during or shortly after the meeting. With adoption of the new Constitution (2016), officers will usually serve for two calendar years. In the transition year (2017), however, some officers will serve for only one year. This will move TDWG into a regular pattern that requires at most half of the Executive Committee to be re-elected and possibly replaced in a given year.

The [Roles and Responsibilities ](http://www.tdwg.org/about-tdwg/executive/exec-comm-2017/fileadmin/executive/TDWG_Executive_Committee_RolesAndResponsibilities.pdf)for the Executive Committee and Secretariat are set forth in the Constitution and supplemented by a document written during the [TDWG Infrastructure Project.](http://www.tdwg.org/about-tdwg/executive/exec-comm-2017/activities/tip/)
