TDWG has individual and institutional members. Contact [secretariat@tdwg.org](mailto:secretariat@tdwg.org) if you want to become a member.

## Benefits of membership

* Voting rights:  TDWG members can vote in TDWG elections (Executive officers, subcommittee Chairs, rules of governance)
* Discount on article publishing charges (APCs) in the TDWG Journal [Biodiversity Information Science and Standards (BISS)](../../journal/)

## Membership schedule

Membership is based on the calendar year.  We solicit membership payments early in the year. Memberships fees can be paid at any time during the year, but apply to the calendar year.

## Membership dues 

### Individual membership

* $75 USD

### Institutional membership

* $500 USD - discounted 20% ($400) for early payment (before 31 March)

## Payment methods

Starting in 2019, TDWG will manage membershp through the Zoho Invoicing platform. Members must establish an account on the platform, but can then pay an invoice (online or offline), print invoices and receipts, and view payment history. [Request an invitation](mailto:secretariat@tdwg.org) to establish your account with TDWG.

Membership dues can be paid:

* online by credit card, or  
* by bank wire (banking details included with an invoice)
* by check drawn on a United States bank.
