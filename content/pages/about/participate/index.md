TDWG is for and by people who create, manage, integrate, and analyze biodiversity information. Most are professional biologists or information scientists, but everyone has a passion for living things. If your goals depend on knowledge of biodiversity and information management, tdwg is good place to learn, share, and collaborate.

## TDWG announcements

Subscribe to the TDWG announcements mailing list. It's for announcements, not discussion, and the volume is low. 

## Annual conference

For many people, their first experience of TDWG comes through participating in the annual conference. These are usually in the Fall and occupy the full five days of a work week (Mon-Fri).  Conferences rotate among the continents on pattern something like "Europe, North America, other", where "other" can be Australia/Oceania, Latin America, Asia, and Africa. Since 2006 the annual conference has drawn betwen 150 and 225 participants.

Conference Proceedings (abstracts of presentations) are available online since 2006. Powerpoint or PDF files are available for many presentations since 2008, and recordings are available for most presentations since 2015.

## Online collaboration

TDWG is now using GitHub as its primary [collaboration platform](https://github.com/tdwg). The content for all [interest groups](../../community/) and [standards](../../standards/) is publicly available, but to participate most effectively you should create a user account on GitHub (free) and ask an admin to join the [TDWG organization](https://github.com/tdwg). With a user account you can monitor the repositories of interest groups and standards relevant to your interests.
